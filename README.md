## Lessons Learned 📋

* How to build and deploy a full-stack application using React, Node, and PSQL.
* How to read API documentation and follow instructions to integrate an AI pre-built model.
* How to use bcrypt and environment variables to hide sensitive information (e.g. passwords).
* How to use npm packages for styling.

## Room for Improvement 🔧

At the moment, if the user uploads an image of a group, the app is only able to recognize one face. This needs to be changed, so it can recognize all the faces in the photo.
