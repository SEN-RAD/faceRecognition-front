# faceRecognition-front

This app was built as the final project during the course Complete Web Developer by Andrei Neagoie.  

### Idea and Functionality

The app uses face recognition AI  (www.clarifai.com/use-cases/facial-recognition). Users register and sign-in to use the app, copy-paste a link to an image, and the app detects the faces in the picture and keeps count of how many pictures the user has uploaded. 

### Lessons Learned

* How to build and deploy a full-stack application using React, Node, and PSQL.
* How to read API documentation and follow instructions to integrate an AI pre-built model.
* How to use bcrypt and environment variables to hide sensitive information (e.g. passwords).
* How to use npm packages for styling (e.g. tachyons, particles, MUI core). 

### Room for Improvement

At the moment, if the user uploads an image of a group, the app is only able to recognize one face. This needs to be changed, so it can recognize all the faces in the photo.
